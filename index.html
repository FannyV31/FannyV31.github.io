      <h1>Testimonials</h1>
      <p>Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.</p>

<p>No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. You can get away with a lot. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. With practice comes confidence.</p>

<p>Learn when to stop. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>
<p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.</p>

<p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every day I learn. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.</p>

<p>We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Brown is such a nice color. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Just make little strokes like that. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.</p>

<p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Poor old tree.</p>

<p>Let the paint work. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.</p>

<p>You're meant to have fun in life. See there how easy that is. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>

<p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.</p>

<p>You're meant to have fun in life. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.</p>

<p>In your world you have total and absolute power. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let your imagination be your guide. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. In this world, everything can be happy.</p>

<p>Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

<p>And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Happy painting, God bless. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>

<p>When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Let your imagination be your guide. Here's something that's fun.</p>

<p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. There comes a nice little fluffer. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>

<p>We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Fluff that up. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.</p>

<p>You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

<p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You can do anything your heart can imagine.</p>

<p>It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>

<p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>

<p>It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>

<p>Anything you want to do you can do here. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. In your world you can create anything you desire. Learn when to stop.</p>
